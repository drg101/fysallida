# Data
This is where all the references to data are. We will also put our finished data in here maybe.

## National Risk Index
This will mostly just be used for visualization at the end. It provides nice indexes that we can put next to ours.

## American Community Survey Data 2005->2009 and 2015->2019
Each of these datasets include:
 - Total Population
 - Median Household Income
 - Median Ages
 - Gini Income Inequality Index
 - Race - Raw Numbers*
 - Educational Attainment By Sex** - Raw Numbers*
 - Ratio Of Income to Poverty Level - Raw Numbers*
 - Occupied Housing Units Rented/Owned (Tenure) - Raw Numbers*
 - Occupancy Status of Housing Units - Raw Numbers*
  
*All "Raw Numbers" will need to be normalized by their corresponding "Total"

**For some reason, the educational attainment is always split by sex for 2005->2009, so some pre-processing will need to be done for that one to make it agnostic to sex.
